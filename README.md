# Mobile Application Development Labs
### Repository for the laboratories of the Mobile Application Development course
The repository contains the 5 laboratories and the final project for the Mobile Application Development course (A.Y. 2022/23, Politecnico di Torino). Each folder contains the PDF of the assignment.

## Lab 1: Kotlin Exercism exercises
4 exercises from the Exercism Kotlin track: Bank account, Forth, List-Ops and Minesweeper

## Labs 2-5 and final project: Playgrounds Reservations
The following labs and the final project were aimed at creating an app for making reservations for available playgrounds to play a selection of sports.

The app is what can be considered a proof of concept: its main goal was to test and showcase all the different technologies that can be used to develop an Android application. For this very reason the app is a mix of activities and fragments, view-based screens and Jetpack Compose ones.

Optimizations were also not performed, mostly due to time constraints: most notably, the whole app operates from the main thread and frequently skips frames.

### Features
- Explore the playgrounds availability, also without logging in
- Login or sign up with email and password or with a Google account
- Visualize already placed reservation through a calendar
- Make a new reservation, selecting a playground from recents or favourites ones or searching for one through filters
- Edit or delete an existing reservation
- Invite friends to a reservation, selecting from recents or favourites users or searching for one
- Receive in-app notifications for incoming invitations to reservations
- Withdraw participation from an accepted invitation to a reservation
- Personalize your profile with personal information to be displayed to friends and users of the app

### Horizontal features
- The app supports multi-language localization and is fully translated in English and Italian
- The app supports both portrait and landscape orientations and the layout is sufficiently diversified for the two alternatives

### Technologies used
- The app is fully developed in Kotlin
- View-based activities and fragment
- Jetpack Compose fragments (to integrate with the navigation graph used for fragments)
- Firebase Firestore database
- Firebase UI authentication
- Firebase storage for saving profile images
- Local Room database for labs 3 and 4

### Known bugs and limitations
- The app supports a dark mode too, but the color scheme was not dutifully considered nor tested
- Accepting an invitation while the inviter disinvites you
- Two users making a reservation at the same time
- In general, concurrency has not been handled
- As previously mentioned, several performance optimizations would be needed
